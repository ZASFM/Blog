Hi, instead of using the conventional way of using a README.md, this time, IÂ´ll use it to explain the project.
The main page is the index.html, and the redirect one is the redirect.html.
Both have the CSS file inside a folder, in case of the index.html file, its CSS files are inside the 'Main CSS files', and, 
when it comes to the redirect.html, you can encounter its CSS files inside the 'Redirect page CSS files'.
--Explanation of the importations:
  --Regarding to the index.html you can see that it is linked to styles.css, and the one has 3 imported files. These 3 files
  take care of the styling of the header-footer, main content and thr little animation at the beginning.

Same thing happens to the redirect.html.
